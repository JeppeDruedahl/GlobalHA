We use the quantitative model to evaluate the consumption-equivalent welfare losses from using simple rules for portfolio allocation across stocks, bonds, and liquid accounts instead of the optimal portfolio choices. We find that the consumption-equivalent losses from using an age-dependent rule as embedded in current targetdate/lifecycle funds (TDFs) are substantial, around 2 to 3 percent of consumption, despite the fact that TDF rules mimic average optimal behavior by age closely until shortly before retirement. Our model recommends higher average equity shares in the second half of life than the portfolio of the typical TDF, so that the typical TDF portfolio does not improve on investing an ageindependent 2/3 share in equity. Finally, optimal equity shares have substantial heterogeneity, particularly by wealth level, state of the business cycle, and dividend-price ratio, implying substantial gains to further customization of advice or TDFs in these dimensions.},

	abstract = {We present a flexible and scalable method for computing global solutions of highdimensional stochastic dynamic models. Within a time iteration or value function iteration setup, we interpolate functions using an adaptive sparse grid algorithm. With increasing dimensions, sparse grids grow much more slowly than standard tensor product grids. Moreover, adaptivity adds a second layer of sparsity, as grid points are added only where they are most needed, for instance, in regions with steep gradients or at nondifferentiabilities. To further speed up the solution process, our implementation is fully hybrid parallel, combining distributed and shared memory parallelization paradigms, and thus permits an efficient use of high-performance computing architectures. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we solve two very different types of dynamic models: first, high-dimensional international real business cycle models with capital adjustment costs and irreversible investment; second, multiproduct menu-cost models with temporary sales and economies of scope in price setting.},

Our method extends standard linearization techniques and is designed to work in cases when inequality matters for the dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates. We present two applications that analyze a two asset incomplete markets model parameterized to match the distribution of income, wealth, and marginal propensities to consume. First, we show that our model is consistent with two key features of aggregate consumption dynamics that are difficult to match with representative agent models: (1) the sensitivity of aggregate consumption to predictable changes in aggregate income, and (2) the relative smoothness of aggregate consumption. Second, we extend the model to feature capital-skill complementarity and show how factor-specific productivity shocks shape dynamics of income and consumption inequality.},

I approximate the distribution with a flexible parametric family, reducing its dimensionality to a finite set of endogenous parameters, and solve for the dynamics of these endogenous parameters by perturbation. I implement the method in Dynare and show that it is fast, general, and easy to use. As an illustration, I use the method to perform a Bayesian estimation of a heterogeneous firm model with aggregate shocks to neutral and investment-specific productivity. I find that the behavior of investment at the firm level quantitatively shapes inference about the aggregate shock processes, suggesting an important role for micro data in estimating DSGE models.

In particular, we direct our attention to problems where the state and/or action space is large and potentially continuous - problems that have shown to be challenging to solve with classic approaches from dynamic programming. In order to illustrate how different classes of algorithms know from reinforcement learning can be applied to approximate solutions to dynamic economic models, we first use a simple Q-learner to solve a moderately large cake-eating problem with discrete states and a finite time horizon. We show that for a relatively low approximation error, the problem can be solved fast with reinforcement learning relative to standard backwards induction. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of the initial guess of action-values and the existence of discontinuities for the performance of the algorithm. With these results in hand, we turn our attention to another class of algorithms from reinforcement learning, Deep Q-Networks, that handle models where the state space is continuous. In order to assess the performance of the algorithm, we evaluate it on a set of infinite horizon engine replacement models when the state and action space are first one-dimensional and then multidimensional. Finally, we discuss the applicability of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients for models where the both states and actions are continuous.},

In this environment, monetary transmission works through investment, but redistribution lowers the elasticity of investment via two channels: (i) heterogeneity in marginal propensities to invest, and (ii) time variation in the liquidity premium. Monetary contractions redistribute to wealthy households who have high propensities to invest and a low marginal value of liquidity, thereby stabilizing investment. I provide empirical evidence for countercyclical liquidity premia and heterogeneity in household portfolio responses.},

Second, incorporating estimated unequal incidence functions for aggregate labor income fluctuations leads to either amplification or dampening, depending on the data and estimation methods. Third, distribution rules for monopoly profits that allocate a larger share to liquid assets lead to greater amplification. Fourth, assumptions about the fiscal reaction to a monetary policy shock have a stronger effect on the aggregate consumption response than any of the other three elements.},

	abstract = {General equilibrium macroeconomic models are a core tool used by policymakers to understand a nation's economy. They represent the economy as a collection of forward-looking actors whose behaviours combine, possibly with stochastic effects, to determine global variables (such as prices) in a dynamic equilibrium. However, standard semi-analytical techniques for solving these models make it difficult to include the important effects of heterogeneous economic actors. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of heterogeneity, for example in age and sector of employment, in macroeconomic outcomes and the need for models that can more easily incorporate it. We use techniques from reinforcement learning to solve such models incorporating heterogeneous agents in a way that is simple, extensible, and computationally efficient. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and stability on a toy problem for which there is a known analytical solution, its versatility by solving a general equilibrium problem that includes global stochasticity, and its flexibility by solving a combined macroeconomic and epidemiological model to explore the economic and health implications of a pandemic. The latter successfully captures plausible economic behaviours induced by differential health risks by age.},

	abstract = {Real economies can be seen as a sequential imperfect-information game with many heterogeneous, interacting strategic agents of various agent types, such as consumers, firms, and governments. Dynamic general equilibrium models are common economic tools to model the economic activity, interactions, and outcomes in such systems. However, existing analytical and computational methods struggle to find explicit equilibria when all agents are strategic and interact, while joint learning is unstable and challenging. Amongst others, a key reason is that the actions of one economic agent may change the reward function of another agent, e.g., a consumer's expendable income changes when firms change prices or governments change taxes. We show that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) can discover stable solutions that are epsilon-Nash equilibria for a meta-game over agent types, in economic simulations with many agents, through the use of structured learning curricula and efficient GPU-only simulation and training. Conceptually, our approach is more flexible and does not need unrealistic assumptions, e.g., market clearing, that are commonly used for analytical tractability. Our GPU implementation enables training and analyzing economies with a large number of agents within reasonable time frames, e.g., training completes within a day. We demonstrate our approach in real-business-cycle models, a representative family of DGE models, with 100 worker-consumers, 10 firms, and a government who taxes and redistributes. We validate the learned meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria through approximate best-response analyses, show that RL policies align with economic intuitions, and that our approach is constructive, e.g., by explicitly learning a spectrum of meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria in open RBC models.},

As an illustration, we solve Krusell and Smith{\textquoteright}s (1998) heterogeneous-agent model with incomplete markets, borrowing constraint and indivisible labor choice. The novel feature of our analysis is that we construct state-contingent discontinuous decision functions that tell us when the agent switches from one employment state to another. We use deep learning not only to characterize the discrete indivisible labor choice but also to perform model reduction and to deal with multicollinearity. Our TensorFlow-based implementation of DLC is tractable in models with thousands of state variables.},

The approach is to employ a `global{\textquoteright} genetic algorithm search for the parameters of the expectation function followed by a `local{\textquoteright} gradient-descent optimization method to ensure fine-tuning of the approximated solution. We use this search procedure in combination with either polynomial or neural network specifications for the expectation function.

This model has a remarkable feature of approximate aggregation: the mean of wealth distribution can be accurately predicted with the mean of past wealth distribution. However, if savings are done through bonds, the HANC model does not have this feature (because the mean of bond holding is zero). We solve such model using deep learning solution method in which the decision function and price functions are approximated in terms of true state space of individual and aggregate state variables. The problem has high dimensionality (hundreds of state variables) and ill-conditioning but neural network reduces dimensionality and restore numerical stability. Our deep learning method delivers accurate and reliable solutions. We also show how to solve a heterogeneous-agent new Keynesian (HANK) model with savings through bonds and a zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate in the absence of Krusell and Smith (1998) aggregation.},

As an application, we find a global solution of a multi-firm version of the classic Lucas and Prescott (1971) model of investment under uncertainty. First, we compare the solution against a linear-quadratic Gaussian version for validation and benchmarking. Next, we solve the nonlinear version where no accurate or closed-form solution exists.

	abstract = {This paper investigates how, in a heterogeneous agents model with financial frictions, idiosyncratic individual shocks interact with exogenous aggregate shocks to generate time-varying levels of leverage and endogenous aggregate risk. To do so, we show how such a model can be efficiently computed, despite its substantial nonlinearities, using tools from machine learning. We also illustrate how the model can be structurally estimated with a likelihood function, using tools from inference with diffusions. We document, first, the strong nonlinearities created by financial frictions. Second, we report the existence of multiple stochastic steady states with properties that differ from the deterministic steady state along important dimensions. Third, we illustrate how the generalized impulse response functions of the model are highly state-dependent. In particular, we find that the recovery after a negative aggregate shock is more sluggish when the economy is more leveraged. Fourth, we prove that wealth heterogeneity matters in this economy because of the asymmetric responses of household consumption decisions to aggregate shocks.},

Because linear strategies are simple to implement, a large class of equilibrium outcomes can be represented with simple perceptions. However, in the presence of imperfect monitoring, the linear proxies can overestimate the hidden variables. The chapter presents bounded rationality as a constraint on computational capabilities. Thus, the main exercise is to construct equilibria sustained by simple neural networks, and to study the ways in which the restriction on strategies reduces the set of equilibrium outcomes. The approach of Rubinstein (1986) presumes that players have access to finite automata that encode transition and outcome functions. It is believed that neural networks are useful tools to study the strategic implications of complexity cost, especially when, the feasible computing machines may have infinite states, and the computing machine can adapt itself as the game progresses.},

We show in particular that they are adaptive to unknown underlying linear structures, such as the dependence on the projection of the input variables onto a low-dimensional subspace. Moreover, when using sparsity-inducing norms on the input weights, we show that high-dimensional non-linear variable selection may be achieved, without any strong assumption regarding the data and with a total number of variables potentially exponential in the number of observations. However, solving this convex optimization problem in infinite dimensions is only possible if the nonconvex subproblem of addition of a new unit can be solved efficiently. We provide a simple geometric interpretation for our choice of activation functions and describe simple conditions for convex relaxations of the finite-dimensional non-convex subproblem to achieve the same generalization error bounds, even when constant-factor approximations cannot be found. We were not able to find strong enough convex relaxations to obtain provably polynomialtime algorithms and leave open the existence or non-existence of such tractable algorithms with non-exponential sample complexities.},

Existing global solution methods often assume bounded rationality in terms of a parametric law of motion of aggregate variables in order to reduce dimensionality. I do not make this assumption and tackle dimensionality by polynomial chaos expansions, a projection technique for square-integrable random variables. This approach results in a nonparametric law of motion of aggregate variables. Moreover, I establish convergence of the proposed algorithm to the rational expectations equilibrium. Economically, I find that higher levels of idiosyncratic risk sharing lead to higher systemic risk, i.e., higher volatility within the ergodic state distribution, and second, heterogeneity leads to an amplification of aggregate risk for sufficiently high levels of risk sharing.},

	abstract = {An efficient, reliable, and interpretable global solution method, the Deep learningbased algorithm for Heterogeneous Agent Models (DeepHAM), is proposed for solving high dimensional heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks. The state distribution is approximately represented by a set of optimal generalized moments. Deep neural networks are used to approximate the value and policy functions, and the objective is optimized over directly simulated paths. In addition to being an accurate global solver, this method has three additional features. First, it is computationally efficient in solving complex heterogeneous agent models, and it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Second, it provides a general and interpretable representation of the distribution over individual states, which is crucial in addressing the classical question of whether and how heterogeneity matters in macroeconomics. Third, it solves the constrained efficiency problem as easily as it solves the competitive equilibrium, which opens up new possibilities for studying optimal monetary and fiscal policies in heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks.},

	abstract = {We propose a scalable method for computing global solutions of nonlinear, highdimensional dynamic stochastic economic models. First, within a time iteration framework, we approximate economic policy functions using an adaptive, high-dimensional model representation scheme, combined with adaptive sparse grids to address the ubiquitous challenge of the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, the adaptivity within the individual component functions increases sparsity since grid points are added only where they are most needed, that is, in regions with steep gradients or at nondifferentiabilities. Second, we introduce a performant vectorization scheme for the interpolation compute kernel. Third, the algorithm is hybrid parallelized, leveraging both distributed- and shared-memory architectures. We observe significant speedups over the state-of-the-art techniques, and almost ideal strong scaling up to at least 1, 000 compute nodes of a Cray XC50 system at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center. Finally, to demonstrate our method{\textquoteright}s broad applicability, we compute global solutions to two variates of a high-dimensional international real business cycle model up to 300 continuous state variables. In addition, we highlight a complementary advantage of the framework, which allows for a priori analysis of the model complexity.},

	abstract = {Solving a workhorse incomplete markets model in continuous time is many times faster compared to its discrete time counterpart. This paper dissects the computational discrepancies and identifies the key bottlenecks. The implicit finite difference method {\textendash} a commonly used tool in continuous time {\textendash} accounts for a large share of the difference. This method is shown to be a special case of Howard{\textquoteright}s improvement algorithm, efficiently implemented by relying on sparse matrix operations. By representing the policy function with a transition matrix it is possible to formulate a similar procedure in discrete time, which effectively eliminates the differences in run-times entirely.},
